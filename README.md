## Technical Architecture

### Server (`Server.java`)
- Creates ServerSocket on port 1234
- Manages concurrent client connections using ConcurrentHashMap
- Handles username validation and uniqueness
- Broadcasts user join/leave notifications
- Maintains real-time user list synchronization

### Client Handler (`ClientHandler.java`)
- Implements Runnable for multithreaded client management
- Processes different message types (group chat, whispers, commands)
- Handles private messaging with `@username` syntax
- Manages client disconnection and cleanup

### Client (`Client.java`)
- JavaFX-based GUI application with modern dark theme
- Real-time message listening on separate thread
- Interactive user list with click-to-whisper functionality
- Multi-window private chat support
- Automatic GUI updates using Platform.runLater()

## Prerequisites

- Java Development Kit (JDK) 8 or higher with JavaFX support
- Make utility (for using the Makefile)
- Network connectivity (application uses IP 10.242.69.49 via ZeroTier VPN)
- JavaFX library

## Installation & Setup

1. Clone or download the project files
2. Navigate to the project directory containing the Makefile
3. Open a terminal in this directory

## Compilation and Execution

This project includes a Makefile for easy compilation and execution. All source files are located in the `src/` directory.

### Starting the Server

To compile all Java files and run the server:

```
make server
```

### Connecting Clients

To compile all Java files and run a client (in a separate terminal):

```
make client
```

**Note**: You can run multiple clients by opening additional terminals and executing `make client` in each.

### Cleaning Build Files

To remove the `bin/` directory containing compiled class files:

```
make clean
```

## Usage

1. **Start the Server**: Run `make server` first - you'll see "Server started." message
2. **Connect Clients**: Run `make client` in separate terminals for each user
3. **Login**: Enter a unique username when prompted
4. **Group Chat**: 
   - Type messages and press Enter to broadcast to all users
   - Your message appears immediately in your chat window
5. **Private Messaging ("Whispers")**:
   - Click on a username in the Active Users list (right panel)
   - Click "Whisper?" when it appears
   - A private chat window opens in the center panel
   - Multiple whisper windows can be open simultaneously
6. **Exit**: Type `/exit` to disconnect cleanly

### Interface Layout
- **Left Panel**: Global chat area with message history and input field
- **Center Panel**: Private whisper windows (opens when initiated)
- **Right Panel**: Active users list (click to start whispers)

## Network Configuration

- **Default IP Address**: 10.242.69.49 (Priyal Bhana ZeroTier VPN)
- **Default Port**: 1234

**Important**: The server must be running before any clients can connect.

## Additional Notes

- The server handles multiple clients concurrently using multithreading
- Client-server communication is thread-safe using synchronized blocks
- The GUI automatically updates user lists when clients join/leave
- Private whisper windows persist until manually closed
- Username validation prevents empty or duplicate usernames
- Robust error handling for network disconnections
